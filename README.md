# Kubernetes the easy way with vagrant

This is the easy version of kubernetes the hard way but with vagrant and all scripted up.

This is based in KTHW: 1.18.6 and goes only until step 12, core-dns and smoke tests can be done manually.

This repository is purely educational, it needs a lot of work be something usable or configurable
and it's not work the effort, use kubeadm and proper environments.

This has been only tested on linux and it works, you will need at least 9 Gbs of free memory for this to run.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
