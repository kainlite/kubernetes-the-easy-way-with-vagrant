# Kubernetes the easy way with vagrant

NOTE: This has not been fully tested, only manually and then fixing some small issues, after that everything worked.

This is the easy version of kubernetes the hard way but with vagrant and all scripted up.

This is based in KTHW: 1.18.6 and goes only until step 12, core-dns and smoke tests can be done manually.

This repository is purely educational, it needs a lot of work be something usable or configurable
and it's not work the effort, use kubeadm and proper environments.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
